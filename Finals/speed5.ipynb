    "# Speed 5 (rev)\n",

    "Challenge file is provided in [speed5](speed5).\n",
    "\n",
    "Speed 1-4 were all incredibly speedy (solved in under half an hour), so there's no reason to expect this to be any different right? Right? (Hint: We were wrong.)\n",
    "\n",
    "It took us about 2.5 hours to solve this challenge, albeit with a breakfast break in between. Anyway, the first thing to note is that you don't really get that much \"actual logic\" from IDA Pro (or any other disassembler/decompiler really). This is because it is quite a barebones VM, and really the only thing it does it to invoke a function in the VM called VERIFY. So we have to look at the code that gets parsed by the VM instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, we can take a shortcut and just look at the ASCII dump of the data section, as it has function names littered all around. We also place red lines to distinguish what we believe are different segments (mainly because it comes right before a LAMBDA):\n",
    "\n",
    "![speed_dump2](speed_dump2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The last section shows the eight functions that are defined natively: MAX, DIV, CONS, CDR, CAR, NAND, MUL, SUB. Most of these are easily inferable, and we note that [CAR and CDR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAR_and_CDR) refers to the head and tail of a Lisp linked list. I have zero experience with Lisp, but have seen similar formulations in F# and Haskell so it wasn't completely unfamiliar territory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rest are functions defined within the VM, some of these you can reasonably infer what they might do from the name:\n",
    "* OR(x, y) = NAND(NOT(x), NOT(y))\n",
    "* NOT(x) = NAND(x, x)\n",
    "* ADD(x, y) = SUB(x, SUB(0, y))\n",
    "* MOD(x, y) = SUB(x, MUL(DIV(x,y), y))\n",
    "* FOLD(...) is a bit harder to read due to the IF, but it very likely does a [fold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fold_(higher-order_function))\n",
    "\n",
    "Which leaves VERIFY, HASH, HELPER, MASSAGE, and LOLWTF. We can make some reasonable guesses from these:\n",
    "* VERIFY(x,y) = if( OR(SUB(HASH(x), ???), SUB(HASH(y), ???) )) then ???\n",
    "* HASH(x) = fold the HELPER function over LOLWTF(x)\n",
    "* MASSAGE(x) = MOD(MUL(SUB(MAX(x, ???), ???), ???), ???)\n",
    "* HELPER(x) = ADD(MASSAGE(MUL(x, ???), ???), ???)\n",
    "* LOLWTF = ???????\n",
    "\n",
    "These are very vague guesses, but at this stage it would greatly help us to hook into the SUB function and record all subtractions. Assuming we've inferred it correctly, then we are simply comparing a function of our string against a target hash. We use Qiling to do this, by hooking at 0x2264:\n",
